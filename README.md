Mostly students know about few courses which are famous but from this site you can get choices and not only of courses but also about the platform according to your budget.**

* **Then our first page is our home in which all the features are shortly available. We have created this website for those who are ready to learn anything, who wants to increase their skills**
* **and lastly who don't care about the quarantine or daily life, they are just born to gloom themselves. And we have also added the blog content in which any one can post their block or article in which they can share about their experience in the course so that other learners can take the advantages.**

## Status

**This project is finished.But we are not able to deploy it due to some major issues.**

## Inspiration

**We have seen if we want to see movie, we just go through on Netflix, prime etc and start watching the movies after seeing their reviews even if we don't know about that movie before. So why don't make a site which show you the available courses and new technologies, through which learners could know about their interest and without wasting time they can start learning and the true confirmation they can check from the blogs and also can ask about their functionality, projects and also about the scope in future using that technology.**
