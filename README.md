## General info

**Through this project we can increase our skills during quarantine as well as in our daily routine. In this project we have created a site through which you can choose different courses from different platforms. You will also get to know the different courses available in the era. Mostly students know about few courses which are famous but from this site you can get choices and not only of courses but also about the platform according to your budget.**

## Status

**This project is finished.But we are not able to deploy it due to some major issues.**

## Inspiration

**We have seen if we want to see movie, we just go through on Netflix, prime etc and start watching the movies after seeing their reviews even if we don't know about that movie before. So why don't make a site which show you the available courses and new technologies, through which learners could know about their interest and without wasting time they can start learning and the true confirmation they can check from the blogs and also can ask about their functionality, projects and also about the scope in future using that technology.**
